I've done so many things over the years that sometimes it's hard to keep track. Luckily, keeping track of things is kind of my passion.

### Mini-Resume
- In September 2014 I moved to NYC to become the office manager for [Wildcard](https://twitter.com/wildcard), and I worked there up until March 2016. 
- In May 2016 I joined [Some Spider](http://www.somespider.com) as the office (happiness) manager but also with both the [ScaryMommy](http://www.scarymommy.com) and [Cafe](http://www.cafe.com) teams on various projects. 
- In January 2017 I signed on with [Flashpoint](http://www.flashpoint-intel.com) as their Operations Manager on the People Ops team. Later that year, I moved over to the Information Technology team where I became the IT Administrator and unoffical Queen of Jira.
- In January 2019 I joined up with [Blink Health](https://www.blinkhealth.com) as an IT Engineer which soon turned into the cooler title of Senior Cloud Applications Engineer. 


### Other Projects of Note
- I maintain the [Basic Land Art](http://basiclandart.tumblr.com) site, a view of the artwork of every basic land in the card game *Magic: The Gathering*, different from other land art sites for being just the art without scraping card scans.
- I produced a bi-weekly podcast about videogames called [Cartridge](https://cartridge.simplecast.fm) with my friends Mike and Twig. You can listen on the website or subscribe to us in [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cartridge/id1375851632). Maybe we'll bring it back someday!
- I did a brief stint as a Let's Player. You can watch my videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2Jxp4_7hGty6SDHwmUSWw) if you want. I'm unlikely to do it again, but who knows?
- My involvement with [BronyCon](http://bronycon.org) started in May 2012 and ended with BronyCon's ending, in August 2019. During my time there I wore many hats: I worked on four different official teams (Audio Visual, Event Programming, External Operations, and Convention Operations) and two unofficial ones (Layout and Helpdesk).
