I've done so many things over the years that sometimes it's hard to keep track. Luckily, keeping track of things is kind of my passion.

### BronyCon
Since May 2012 I've been working for [BronyCon](http://bronycon.org), the world's first (yes, there are many) *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* fan convention. I've worn a lot of hats. Here they are by year.

- BronyCon 2013 (Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, MD): Head of AV
- BronyCon 2014 (Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, MD): Deputy Head of Events, Layout
- BronyCon 2015 (Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, MD): Deputy Head of Events, Head of Layout, Convention Operations Staff

### New York, New York
- In September 2014 I moved to NYC to become the office manager for [Wildcard](https://twitter.com/wildcard), and I worked there up until support for the app ended in March 2016. 
- In May 2016 I joined [Some Spider](http://www.somespider.com) as the office (happiness) manager but also with both the [ScaryMommy](http://www.scarymommy.com) and [Cafe](http://www.cafe.com) teams on various projects. The teams there do amazing work, but I was still searching for my home, and:
- In January 2017 I found a home with [Flashpoint](http://www.flashpoint-intel.com) as their Operations Manager. Later that year, I moved over to the Information Technology team where I now work as the IT Administrator and Queen of JIRA (the second title is unofficial...for now).

### Other Projects
- I did a brief stint as a Let's Player. You can watch my videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/emeraldsilver) if you want. I'm unlikely to do it again, but who knows?
- I maintain the [Basic Land Art](http://basiclandart.tumblr.com) site, a view of the artwork of every basic land in the card game *Magic: The Gathering*, different from other land art sites for being just the art without scraping card scans.
- I produce a bi-weekly podcast about videogames called [Cartridge](https://cartridge.simplecast.fm) with my friends Mike and Twig. You can listen on the website or subscribe to us in [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cartridge/id1375851632).
