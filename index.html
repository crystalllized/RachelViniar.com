			<p class="salutation">Dear Rachel,</p>
		
			<p>Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, Happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Holidays">"Holiday"</a>.</p>
			
			 <p>I love you a whole lot. Like, a lot, <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>. This year, I decided to give you fun things like video games and that thing in the wrapping paper, because you're really fun, and you really like having fun. So that seems to make sense, I think.</p>		
			<p>Anyway, I know we've had a bunch of rough days lately, but I want you to know that <strong>I love you</strong>, and I love being with you. I hope you really know that, and you understand that no matter how much we argue, or disagree, I think you're an amazing person.</p>
			<p>I love listening to your thoughts, and I really like arguing with you, because your thoughts help to clarify and crystallize my own.</p>
			<p>Also, I made you this little website and I can help you make a real one if you want, or you can just have it. I'm sure you'll use it for awesome things.</p>

<p class="love">Love,<br /> <a href="http://matthewbischoff.com">Matt</a></p>
