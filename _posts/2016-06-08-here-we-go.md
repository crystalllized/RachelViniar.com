*me, telling Matt about organizing shirts*  
"You should write a blog about this!"

*me, talking to Matt about my day at work dealing with hunting down a missing ping pong table*  
"This would make a really good blog post!"

*me, complaining about the strange ways in which Google Apps work (or don't)*  
"I bet people would totally read this blog."

So, here we are. While the pictures were pretty, the `hover` very clever, and the rainbow of social icons were the Apple Watch layout before Apple Watch was a thing, it's probably about time I put my domain to good use. 

Stay tuned!
